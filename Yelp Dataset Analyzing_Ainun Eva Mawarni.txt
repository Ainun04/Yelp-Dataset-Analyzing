Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet




Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i.    Attribute table   = 10000
ii.   Business table    = 10000
iii.  Category table    = 10000
iv.   Checkin table     = 10000
v.    elite_years table = 10000
vi.   friend table      = 10000
vii.  hours table       = 10000
viii. photo table       = 10000
ix.   review table      = 10000
x.    tip table         = 10000
xi.   user table        = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i.    Business    = 10000 (Primary key:id)
ii.   Hours       = 1562  (Foreign key:business_id)
iii.  Category    = 2643  (Foreign key:business_id)
iv.   Attribute   = 1115  (Foreign key:business_id)
v.    Review      = 10000 (Primary key:id), 8090 (Foreign Key:business_id), 9581 (Foreign Key:user_id)
vi.   Checkin     = 493   (Foreign key:business_id)
vii.  Photo       = 10000 (Primary key:id)
viii. Tip         = 537   (Foreign Key:user_id), 3979 (Foreign Key:business_id)
ix.   User        = 10000 (Primary key:id)
x.    Friend      = 11    (Foreign Key:user_id)
xi.   Elite_years = 2780  (Foreign Key:user_id)

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer:No

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
	i. 	Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
		Answers	:Yes, The business groups with 4-5 star rating have shorter working hours or start working later

	ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
		Answers	:No, there are business groups with a 4-5 star rating that have less reviews than a business group with a 2-3 star rating 

    iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
    	Answers	:No, because every business group has a different postal code

SQL code used for analysis:

	select b.postal_code,b.name,c.category,b.city,b.review_count,h.hours,
	case WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 2 AND 3 THEN '2-3 ' 
	     WHEN B.stars BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THEN '4-5 ' 
	     end as rating
	from category c inner join business b on c.business_id=b.id 
	     inner join hours h on h.business_id=b.id
	where category like 'restaurants' and city like 'toronto'
	order by rating desc
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
   
   Group business that are still open have star rating higher than those that have closed
   avg(stars) of Group business that are still open	= 3.67900943396 
   avg(stars) of Group business that are closed		= 3.52039473684
         
ii. Difference 2:
	
	Group business that are still open have higher number of review than those that have closed
	avg(review_count) of Group business that are still open	= 31.7570754717 
  	avg(review_count) of Group business that are closed		= 23.1980263158
         
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT is_open,count(distinct(id)),avg(stars),avg(review_count)
	FROM business
	group by is_open

	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
	
	analysis of the relationship between category with the number of business groups running that category 
	and the star rating for that category
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
    To find out the effect of categories on the number of business groups running those categories, I calculated the average of the star ratings for each category. Data of star ratings is a form of assessment from users or consumers of these businesses
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
